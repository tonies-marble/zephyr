 * Suspend/resume tests for the Ameba SoCs.
 *
 * These are regression guards for the SoC power-management port, not a
 * demonstration of it. Suspend-to-RAM on this hardware depends on the flash and
 * SRAM layout, on which devicetree nodes are enabled, on the secure image and
 * bootloader restoring state the resume path does not re-initialise, and on the
 * timers that survive the power-down -- all of which are maintained by other
 * people for other reasons (TF-M, MCUboot/OTA, drivers). Every check below
 * corresponds to a defect that was actually hit during the port, so that
 * re-introducing one fails here instead of silently taking the AP down.
 *
 * Two kinds of check:
 *
 *   - Build-time (BUILD_ASSERT below): the devicetree and Kconfig premises the
 *     PM code relies on. These fail the build with an explanation rather than
 *     hanging a board, and they are the ones most likely to catch a change made
 *     elsewhere in the tree.
 *   - Run-time: one cycle of the requested state per case, then
 *     pm_check_resume_invariants() over everything the resume path has to bring
 *     back. The kernel-clock bounds are part of this: k_uptime_get() is fed by
 *     the SoC's own sleep-time recovery, so it catches that going wrong in
 *     either direction -- under-reporting (the clock stalling across the sleep)
 *     and over-reporting (the ROM's SYSTIMER_GetPassTick() taking a reset
 *     counter for a wrapped one and crediting ~2^32 ticks).
 *
 * The residency the kernel idles to reaches hardware on every target, so an idle
 * k_msleep() comes back on its own: the ameba PMC owns a wake timer on the Cortex-M
 * SoCs, and on AmebaSmart the LP core arms an AON timer from the sleep time the AP
 * publishes. test_kernel_deadline_ends_the_sleep checks exactly that, with no wake
 * source armed by anyone.
 *
 * The wake-source cases nevertheless block on a semaphore their callback gives
 * rather than on a kernel timeout, so that each one proves its own source ended
 * the sleep rather than the kernel's deadline doing it.
